== Introduction
Invités is a desktop application targeted at event managers and planners. The application allows you to efficiently *organise, cater, and manage* large events such
as weddings, school gatherings, orientation camps, etc. The application works on a command line interface, where you can key in the commands specified in our User Guide into a command box to perform a task.
Some of the main distinguishing features of the application include the ability to send mass emails to guests, keep track of payments, and take note of guest attendance.
The application also allows you to input the proposed or confirmed details of your event and provides a countdown to the event date.
To add to these features, by employing a standardised format, the application is able to take in Comma Separated Values (CSV) files and import the guest list for a particular event.
This eliminates the need to key in the guest details manually and gives you an alternative if you decide to organise another event using the same guest list.

You will have an easier time managing the reception of your event as you will be equipped with tools that will minimise errors in catering,
organising, and ordering. Moreover, our application aims to reduce your frustration while planning events by packaging your needs in a platform that is more user-friendly, personalised, and efficient.

The main purpose of this User Guide is to give you a detailed overview of all the features in our application and how to use them.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest jar file from the GIT repository link:https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-F09-3/main/releases[here].
.  Place the jar file where your home directory resides
.  Double click on the jar file and wait a couple of seconds as the application loads. If you're successful, a main screen will load
   similar to the one shown below: +

.  As the Command Line Input is your primary method of manipulation, here are some
   example commands that you can use:

* `help` : Displays a summary of the list of commands that the application offers.
* `add_guest` : Adds a guest to the guest list.
* `delete_guest` : Deletes an entry from the guest list.
* `mark` : Marks the attendance of a guest from `ABSENT` to `PRESENT`.
* `exit` : exits the application.

.  You should type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Please refer to <<Features>> subsection to see more detailed documentation of the functions that
   are included in this application
.  If you would like to perform emailing services through our application, please complete the steps as listed
   in <<Enabling Email Services>>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you e.g. in `add_guest n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_guest n/Bob Lee`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Bob Lee t/VIP` or as `n/Bob Lee`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/VIP`, `t/VIP t/Vegetarian` etc.

=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the guest list to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +

====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the guest list's content (`add_guest`, `delete_guest`, `edit_guest`, `removeTag`, `addTag`, `clear` and
`import`) and the event details display's content('add_event', 'edit_event' and 'delete_event'). The other commands we provide are therefore *not* undoable.

`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete_guest 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete_guest 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

== Enabling Email Services

In order for you to use the commands `email`, `emailAll`, and `emailSpecific` you must allow Invités to access your email account and
send emails. Currently, our application only supports Gmail accounts, but we do plan on supporting other email domains.

If you do have a *Gmail* account, please follow these steps to enable email services:

1. Login to your Gmail account using your preferred online browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox).
2. Click on your profile picture on the top right, and click on `Google Account`
3. Once you are re-directed, under the `Sign-in and security` section, click on `Apps with account access`
4. Scroll down till you find the section `Allow less secure apps` on the right. Set this option to `ON`.
5. You are now ready to send emails to your guests through Invités!

[WARNING]
Currently there is no other way to enable mailing services than to let your Gmail account allow less secure apps. However, our team is working quickly to find a more secure replacement.

[IMPORTANT]
If your operating system is *macOS Mojave*, please make an *important* note of the following:

1. If you use any of the email-related commands (i.e. _email_, _emailAll_ or _emailSpecific_), you will be presented with an EmailWindow similar to
the one in *Figure 4*.

2. If you use the *command-tab* keys *when the EmailWindow is open* to switch windows, the application will crash. This is due to
Apple's latest macOS release, in which some of the bindings are not compatible with key JavaFX functions.

3. This issue does not occur on Windows, Linux, and older macOS systems, however it _may still exist_ in other operating systems we have not tested on.

4. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused, and our team is quickly trying to fix this issue.

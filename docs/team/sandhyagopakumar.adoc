== PROJECT: Invités

== Overview

The purpose of this portfolio is to document my role and contributions to my team's project, Invités,
for the module: Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Programming(CS2113T) at the National University of Singapore.

==== _Project Scope_

Invités is a desktop application that caters to event managers and planners.
The application strives to aid our target users through features such as mass-email communication, guest list filtration, attendance marking by unique ID, import or export of CSVs containing guest lists and event details management.
The application works on a Command Line Interface(CLI), where users key in the commands specified in our User Guide into a command box to perform a task.
We have also provided a Graphical User Interface(GUI).
The application was programmed using Java and has approximately 10k lines of code.

==== _My responsibility - Event details Management_

My task involved the creation of an event details component that lets our users input the confirmed event details. I completed this task by implementing the following steps:

* Creating an event model with all the required classes and editing the existing model

* Handling the storage component for event details

* Creating a user interface component for event details

* Creating the 'add_event', 'delete_event' and 'edit_event' commands to add, delete and edit event details in our application

==== _Teammates_

The team that worked with me on this project and the major feature they implemented are as follows:

	1. Sarah Taaher Bonna - Guest List Management
	2. Aaryam Srivastava - Mass Email Communication
	3. Tan Tze Guang - Attendance Management
	4. Tan Wei Ming - Data Sharing



== Summary of contributions
|===
|_The purpose of this section is to list my contributions to Invités._
|===

* *Feature*: Added *the event details component*
** _What it does_: Allows the user to enter the confirmed details for the event they are organising.
** _Justification_: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will want to view specific details that they need to prioritise/reiterate in the days leading up to the event. A count of the days left to the user's event is also displayed for the user's benefit.
** _Highlights_: This enhancement affects the existing logic, model, user interface and storage components as it involves the creation of a new model, the add_event ,delete_event and edit_event commands, an additional storage class as well as a user interface component.
** _Credits_: Reused some ideas from the SE-EDU AddressBook Level 4

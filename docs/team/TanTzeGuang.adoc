== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the function to mark attendance of the attendees in the Guest list
** What it does: This function allows the person planning an event to keep track of the number of attendees whom have arrived at the event by marking them as present or absent during the event itself.
** Justification: This feature is necessary in the implementation of our guest list as it is a core feature that gives the event planner peace of mind as it is a tool for them to ensure that the event is run smoothly.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
